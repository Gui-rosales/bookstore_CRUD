# bookstore_CRUD
Simple crud application using node.js, express and sequelize.

That's a similiar version of my previou project simple_CRUD_express. Here I'm using the same routes, but with some additions, where the main one is the implementation of sequelize. That allows me to insert, collect, change and delete data from a database. The database choosen was mariaDB.
